# FloppyBird

## Name
Genetic algoritm vs DeepQ learning for training FloppyBird agent

## Description
This project includes implementation for both NEAT aca evolving arbitrary neural networks and DeepQ learning using neural networks working with the same environment

## Installation
Using pip install folowing packages in your virtual environment:
- pip install neat-python
- pip install pygame
- pip install tensorboard
- pip install torch
- pip install numpy

## Usage
For running the genetic/NEAT algorithm start game.py in the main directory.
For running the DeepQ algorith start DeepQ/pokusaj10.py for training and DeepQ/observe.py for running on already thained network. Further more you can open tensorborad from terminal or from DeepQ/pokusaj10.py to see the learning proces.
